Password Combination Generator
A C program that generates all possible combinations of characters up to a specified length using recursive string generation.
Overview
This program takes a set of characters and a maximum length as input, then generates all possible combinations of those characters up to the specified length. It uses recursion to build and print each possible combination.
Features

Command line argument support
Dynamic memory allocation
Recursive string generation
All possible combinations generation
Variable number of input characters
Configurable maximum length

Algorithm
The program uses a recursive approach to generate combinations:

Starts with an empty string
For each available character:

Adds it to current string
Prints the new combination
Recursively generates all possibilities with the new string


Continues until reaching maximum length

Command Line Usage
bash./password_gen m char1 char2 ... charm n
Where:

m: Number of characters to use
char1 through charm: The characters to use
n: Maximum length of combinations

Example:
bash./password_gen 3 a b c 2
This will generate all possible combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' up to length 2.
Output Format
The program prints each combination on a new line, generating combinations in order of increasing length.
Example output for above command:
a
b
c
aa
ab
ac
ba
bb
bc
ca
cb
cc
Implementation Details
Functions
printPasswords
cvoid printPasswords(int m, char** arr, int n, char* ans)
Parameters:

m: Number of available characters
arr: Array of characters to use
n: Maximum remaining length
ans: Current string being built

Memory Management

Dynamic allocation for character array
Dynamic allocation for answer string
Memory cleanup in recursive calls

Limitations

No input validation
Memory usage grows with recursion depth
No duplicate character checking
Limited error handling
Assumes well-formed command line arguments
All combinations are stored in memory

Examples
Basic Usage
bash./password_gen 2 0 1 2
Output:
0
1
00
01
10
11
Complex Usage
bash./password_gen 4 a b c d 3
Output:
a
b
c
d
aa
ab
...
ddd
Future Improvements
Potential enhancements could include:

Input validation
Error handling for:

Invalid arguments
Memory allocation failures
Maximum recursion depth


Option to:

Filter combinations
Sort output
Remove duplicates
Save to file


Memory optimization
Progress indicator for large sets
Pattern-based generation
Character class support (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols)

Technical Requirements

C compiler (GCC recommended)
Command line interface
Sufficient memory for recursion

Error Handling
The program should be enhanced to handle:

Invalid number of arguments
Invalid m or n values
Memory allocation failures
Maximum string length limits
Stack overflow prevention
